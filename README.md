All R code was written using R version 4.1.1

The scripts in this repository assume that whoever is running them
has a few packages already installed in their Rstudio environment:
"class"
"caTools"
"caret"
"e1071"

The scripts also assume that you have already downloaded the transfusions dataset
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
